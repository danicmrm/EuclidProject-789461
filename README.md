# Financial market predicting by using LSTM, SVR, XGBoost models
Authors: Daniyar Meiram, Hadra Modre
# Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement ML algorithms that can forecast financial time series data accurately. By utilizing various ML techniques such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, XGBoost ( Extreme Gradient Boosting), and SVR (Support Vector Regression), we aim to create predictive models capable of capturing complex patterns in the data and making accurate predictions of asset prices.

# Model selection
In this project, we used LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), SVR (Support Vector Regression), and XGBoost due to their strengths in dealing with financial time series forecasting. The LSTM networks are best suited for the capturing of long-term dependencies that characterize time-series data which is important in the understanding of financial market dynamics and patterns that develop over time. Their memory for past events and their capacity to retain them for long periods make them useful in financial applications where patterns can last for any length of time. On the other hand, SVR is preferred due to its properties in dealing with high-dimensional spaces and its ability to control overfitting which is indispensable for dealing with the many variables that impact the financial markets. Its kernel trick is helpful in the modeling of the non-linear behavior that is common in price movements and market trends.

XGBoost enhances these models by offering a fast, scalable, and efficient implementation of gradient boosting that is particularly effective for big data environments with various types of features. It has a built-in regularization which helps to control overfitting and can therefore be used for prediction with high reliability.
# Results
LSTM Results: The results from the LSTM model indicated high R-squared values across various markets, which signified the ability of the model to capture the underlying trends in the financial time series like Amazon. However, it did not perform consistently well as seen in IBM where it only gave an R-squared value of 0. 655. The high MAE and MSE in cases like Nasdaq and S&P 500 also indicates that although LSTM is capable of modelling complex patterns, it is also susceptible to noise and volatility which can result in large prediction error in more volatile markets.

SVR Results: SVR model showed high R-squared values especially in the Nasdaq. 996) and S&P 500 (0. 997) thus reflecting a strong predictive power and insensitivity to market movements. The lower errors in MAE and RMSE compared to LSTM in most datasets further demonstrate that it is able to better deal with non-linear price movements. However, in markets such as CAC and IBM, while still showing good results, the performance was lower than other datasets, which indicates that SVR might not perform well on datasets with high or low volatility changes.

XGBoost Results: XGBoost was able to produce some positive results in terms of error metrics like MAE and MSE for less volatile datasets like Amazon and S&P 500 but showed low R-squared values for several markets including Microsoft and Nasdaq whose R-squared values were as low as -2. 376 and -1. 263 respectively. This suggests that XGBoost is able to work well with the different types of features but can easily overfit and fail to generalize in more complex datasets unless there is proper parameter tuning and regularization which can lead to unreliable predictions in the real-world trading environment.
